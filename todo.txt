<TODO>

>number the studies based on FILTERED search results, not the raw unfiltered search results

>?remove ability to sort results, nobody really uses it because there's just too many studies to manually look through
 and removing it will make things more consistent/set-in-stone

>If provided, use USER-GENERATED CUSTOM IDs as the QUERY NUMBERING. Also add this to the default excel_headings.json

>Change the "ALL" filter to not be an actual filter, but rather let it be used as a way to make global changes to all the other filters.
 To make this change, it would be easier to just refactor

>add ability to look forward/backwards from date, to hit the edge case where REPORT DATE is given by the user but the report was actually created on a date AFTER the actual STUDY DATE
 (happens when study was done right before midnight, or sometimes the less urgent MRIs are read days after they're actually taken)

>finish the FORMAT_TIME() function so we don't have to disable it lol (1) format to '%06d' (2) add functionality to fudge the seconds if user only has minutes/hours? low priority 

>ability to CANNIBALIZE tags in anonymization tab

>ability for user to choose what specific columns to load/map when loading a query file

>ability to PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF (if the transfer is cancelled early, change status of queued but undownloaded
    studies to "CANCELLED" and then add a checkbox to choose "overwrite" vs "continue"

>currently always create new folder, does not overwrite old folders
        reenable SKIP_ONFILE check individual images for their series, not only the existence of study folder. This can
        get tricky because we still have no way to know exactly how many images are supposed to be in each series/study,
         so even if we can see the existence of at least 1 image from a series/study, we cannot guarantee that we have
          all of them

>post-download anonymization tab - see matt

<Unimplemented>
   -3. PBP DATES ARE DIFFERENT - ?if accession exists, should we ignore other study identifiers? (but then have to keep
   series identifiers)
   -2. synonyms - GET LIST OF STUDY DESCRIPTIONS
   -1. parse_func - low priority, user should already have their list of desired studies and really shouldn't be
   filtering by these
            patientage - 064Y format
            series - MULTIPLE SERIES ';' separator for multiple desired series in a single row
   0. ULTRASOUND IMAGE RAW ANONYMIZATION - can easily cut images, but will be difficult to know WHERE to cut, and may be
    dependent on the machine/brand. Low yield.

        >?automatically assimilate any new tags we encounter
    5. add post-download anonymization tab to be able to go back and anonymize studies after we download them
